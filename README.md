In the realm of Information Technology (IT), the advent of blockchain technology has ushered in a new era of decentralized and trustless applications. The focus of this thesis revolves around the development and deployment of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) that incorporates Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), leverages the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and integrates Web3 technologies. The project encompasses a myriad of cutting-edge tools and frameworks, to create a comprehensive Web3.0 product.

The primary challenge addressed by this research is the existing gap in decentralized applications catering to the seamless creation, management, and interaction with NFTs. In the current landscape, while blockchain technology has gained momentum, the integration of user-friendly interfaces and functionalities for NFT-related operations remains underexplored.

Additionally, the lack of standardized and user-friendly APIs for Web3 interactions poses a hindrance to the widespread adoption of blockchain-based applications. This research aims to contribute by building a Web3 API that enables users to seamlessly upload NFTs to IPFS and perform API requests to fetch all smart contract data from the IPFS blockchain.

In essence, the problem statement encapsulates the imperative to bridge the gap between the potential of blockchain technology and its user-friendly, practical implementation. This project seeks to address these challenges by delivering a feature-rich and aesthetically pleasing Web3.0 product with a focus on NFT creation, management, and interaction, along with decentralized and resilient data storage solutions.
